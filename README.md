# Thank you to Alex Burton
I like to say a thank you to Alex, my friend, and following his GitHub at https://github.com/Burtonia, for helping with the quotes to ticks problem. Under lib folder, in the utils.ts file, Alex discovered that I used quotes and brought to my attention I should use ticks. All works flawlessly in Stripe. Thanks, Alex.

## Web server deployment
After testing and final UI design, will deploy on a cPanel web server SSL and a non-cPanel
web server SSL for performance and compatibility. Try testing on an Atlantic web server
with Ubantu and Comodo SSL.
